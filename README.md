# Auto Ignore Languages

This plugin was made for 6b6t and against the current "turk-invasion" but should work on other servers if the seperator is configurated correctly.

Automatically ignore certain selectable languages:

- Spanish
- Turkish
- Polish
- Swedish
- French
- Russian
- Arabic
- Hindi

*More will be added soon...*
